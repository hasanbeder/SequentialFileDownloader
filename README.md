<p align="left"> üì• "sequential_file_downloader.py" is an awesome Python script that downloads files sequentially using a user-specified URL template. With this script, the user simply needs to enter a URL template that contains a numerical value to be replaced by the file name, and the script does the rest. It downloads the files sequentially, starting from the numerical value in the URL, and provides the user with information such as download speed, file size, and duration during the process. Plus, the user gets to choose the download directory where the files will be saved. The script will continue downloading files from the URL until it can't find any more.</p><br>

<p align="left"> üìå This script is a real lifesaver when it comes to downloading multiple files in a sequence. Whether you need to download large files or just a bunch of small ones, the script has got you covered. Its user-friendly interface makes it super easy to use, and the fact that the download process is completely automated means that users can sit back and relax while the script does all the work.</p><br>

<p align="left"> üîÜ Imagine you're browsing an e-book site and want to download a book. The site has images of the book, and you've copied the link to the first image. But downloading all those images can be a real hassle, right? That's where "Sequential File Downloader" comes in! It downloads the images sequentially, starting from a user-specified URL template. And once the download is complete, you can merge the images into a PDF file and start reading right away. With this script, downloading e-books has never been easier or more hassle-free!</p><br>
