# Sequential File Downloader
"**sequential_file_downloader.py**" is a Python script designed to download files sequentially using a specified URL template. The script determines the path where the files will be downloaded by using a URL template specified by the user, which must contain a numerical value that will be replaced by the file name. The script downloads the files sequentially, starting from the numerical value in the entered URL. During the download process, the script displays information such as download speed, file size, and download time to the user. The user must specify a download directory during the program's operation, which is the location where the downloaded files will be saved. The script continues to download files from the URL created by the URL template until no files are found.

Thanks to this script, users can download multiple files in sequence using a specific URL template, which can be very useful in scenarios such as downloading large files or many files. The script has a simple user interface and is easy to use. The file download process is completely automated, so users do not need to constantly monitor the download process. All of these features together make "sequential_file_downloader.py" an ideal solution for users who want to perform file download operations quickly and easily.
